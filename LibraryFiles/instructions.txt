These files will do 2 things:
1 - Watchy enables the new PCF8563 RTC to work with this multiwatchface package
2 - GxEPD2 enables extended border colors

RTC Support uses Watchy Library 1.2.7:
Copy Watchy.cpp and Watchy.h into your Arduino/libraries/Watchy/src folder.
You can overwrite the files there, or back up the originals. To restore the originals,
just reinstall the library from your library manager.

Borders (Optional) uses GxEPD2 Library 1.3.9:
Copy the GxEPD2_154_D67.cpp & GxEPD2_154_D67.h into Arduino/libraries/GxEPD2/src/epd 
folder. You can overwrite the originals or back them up. To restore the originals,
just reinstall the library from your library manager.

Once copied over, this functionality must be enabled by editing borders.h and 
uncommenting //#define ENABLEBORDERS so that preprocessor directives will enable the
code necessary in watchy999.h and various watch faces.

Pressing the Top Right button on certain watch faces will toggle light or dark mode.
When in dark mode, the dark background will no longer have a black border around it.
Furthermore, some screens, like Sleep Screen, will have a much nicer presentation.

@GuruSR from the #Watchy discord channel has kindly provided this library and border
code for fellow enthusiast devs. Without his contribution, you likely would not be
running any of my watch faces on the new PCF8563 watchys until @SQFMI releases a real
solution that makes porting existing code easy to do.

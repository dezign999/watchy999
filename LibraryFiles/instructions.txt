GxEPD2 allows for changing the default white border to black

Borders (Optional) uses GxEPD2 Library 1.3.9:
Copy the GxEPD2_154_D67.cpp & GxEPD2_154_D67.h into Arduino/libraries/GxEPD2/src/epd 
folder. You can overwrite the originals or back them up. To restore the originals,
just reinstall the library from your library manager.

Once copied over, this functionality must be enabled by editing borders.h and 
uncommenting //#define ENABLEBORDERS so that preprocessor directives will enable the
code necessary in watchy999.h and various watch faces.

Pressing the Top Right button on certain watch faces will toggle light or dark mode.
When in dark mode, the dark background will no longer have a black border around it.
Furthermore, some screens, like Sleep Screen, will have a much nicer presentation.
